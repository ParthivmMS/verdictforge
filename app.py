        In my first year at a government law college, I faced a problem that many students silently struggle with ‚Äî judgment fatigue.  
        Long, dense court decisions that took hours to read. Confusing legal jargon. No one to explain it simply.

        I thought, what if I could build something that explains these judgments like a senior ‚Äî clearly, briefly, and usefully?

        That‚Äôs how **VerdictForge** was born.

        With no tech background, I used AI (Mistral via OpenRouter) and Streamlit to build a tool that:
        - Breaks down judgments into simplified summaries
        - Highlights legal issues, reasoning, and decisions
        - Provides both legal and plain English explanations

        This isn‚Äôt just a summarizer. It‚Äôs a study companion, a research accelerator, and a time-saver.

        My vision is to grow VerdictForge into a full legal AI assistant ‚Äî helping students, lawyers, and law firms across India.

        If you're reading this, you're part of that journey. Let‚Äôs reshape legal education together.

        For years, law students and junior advocates have struggled through endless pages of judgments.

        We copy-paste from SCC Online, Manupatra, or court websites‚Ä¶ then read‚Ä¶ re-read‚Ä¶ summarize by hand.

        It‚Äôs exhausting.

        While legal knowledge is essential, the system makes it inefficient. Reading judgments should feel like gaining insight ‚Äî not surviving a punishment.

        That‚Äôs where AI comes in. At **VerdictForge**, we‚Äôre not replacing lawyers. We‚Äôre removing the friction between you and legal understanding.

        Think of us as your personal legal intern who reads fast, writes crisply, and never complains.

        With every summary we generate, we‚Äôre giving time back to law students, researchers, and overworked professionals.

        This is legal productivity ‚Äî built for India.

        Let‚Äôs face it: the legal world in India is deeply tiered.

        National Law University (NLU) students often get better internships, more exposure, and stronger networks.  
        But what about the rest of us?

        I study in a government law college. I don‚Äôt have the alumni power or firm contacts. But I have one edge ‚Äî **technology**.

        With tools like VerdictForge, any law student can:
        - Read judgments faster
        - Understand complex decisions in plain English
        - Save time for internships, moots, and writing

        AI doesn‚Äôt care where you study. It levels the playing field.

        My dream is to make legal tech accessible to every student ‚Äî especially from non-NLU backgrounds.  
        If we use AI smartly, we can stand out based on skill ‚Äî not brand.

        And that‚Äôs exactly what VerdictForge is for.
