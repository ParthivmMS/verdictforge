    st.markdown("""
    In my first year at a government law college, I faced a problem that many students silently struggle with ‚Äî judgment fatigue.  
    Long, dense court decisions that took hours to read. Confusing legal jargon. No one to explain it simply.

    I thought, what if I could build something that explains these judgments like a senior ‚Äî clearly, briefly, and usefully?

    That‚Äôs how **VerdictForge** was born.

    With no tech background, I used AI (Mistral via OpenRouter) and Streamlit to build a tool that:
    - Breaks down judgments into simplified summaries
    - Highlights legal issues, reasoning, and decisions
    - Provides both legal and plain English explanations

    This isn‚Äôt just a summarizer. It‚Äôs a study companion, a research accelerator, and a time-saver.

    My vision is to grow VerdictForge into a full legal AI assistant ‚Äî helping students, lawyers, and law firms across India.

    If you're reading this, you're part of that journey. Let‚Äôs reshape legal education together.
